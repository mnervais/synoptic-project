# Interactive Community Events Map Prototype - Apprenticeship Project


## Welcome
Welcome to the repository for my apprenticeship project - the Interactive Community Events Map prototype. As part of my apprenticeship, I've been tasked with creating a working prototype of an events map. The task was to develop an application that displays upcoming local events on an interactive map, encouraging community engagement and participation.


## Project Overview
For this project, my primary goal was to create a functional prototype of the application. The purpose of this prototype is to showcase the potential features and benefits to stakeholders, giving them a tangible example of what the final application could offer. The project goals were:
1. **Design and Build:**
   Design and build an application that fulfills the specified business requirements. This includes the display of event information, interactive filtering, and user-friendly navigation.
3. **Thorough Testing:**
   Rigorously test the application to ensure it aligns with the requirements outlined in the project brief.
4. **Proof of Concept Delivery:**
   Successfully deliver the proof of concept solution within a maximum of 5 days from project initiation.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:**
   Provide comprehensive documentation that covers both the technical aspects and user functionalities of the application.


## Deliverables and Outputs
To demonstrate the successful completion of the project tasks I had to provide a series of outputs as outlined by the project requirements:
- **Design:**
  Create detailed documentation outlining the design elements of the application. This includes assumptions, changes to requirements, textual and diagrammatic representations of design, use cases, sequence diagrams, and a data model.
- **Application Code:**
  Develop application code that implements the Events Map, adhering to best coding practices and architectural guidelines. All code and associated work products will be provided, including the data source.
- **Testing:**
  Design and execute a set of tests that validate the Events Map's adherence to requirements. Document test outcomes, highlighting expected versus actual results.
- **Documentation:**
  Provide documentation discussing design and implementation limitations, proposed improvements, and a user guide video.


## Technologies Used
- Front-end: React.js
- Back-end: Node.js/Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL/PostGIS
- Cloud Provider: Heroku


## Key Features
During the development, I focused on implementing key features that align with the project's objectives:
- Displaying upcoming community events with relevant details.
- Allowing users to filter events based on categories, dates, and locations.
- Enhanced filtering: Filtering mechanism that selectively displays events based on the user's map coordinates and ensures that only events within the user's geographical vicinity are showcased.


## Getting started
Here's how to set up the prototype on your local machine (You will need to setup/configure your own Postgres on your own as well as create a .env file to pass your credentials into):
1. Clone this repository to your computer by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mnervais/synoptic-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd synoptic-project
```

3. Install any necessary dependencies:
```
cd client
npm install
cd ..
cd server
npm install
```

4. Start the application:
```
cd ..
npm start
```
